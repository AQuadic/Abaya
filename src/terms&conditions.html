            <p class="text-[#2d2d2d] text-base mt-5">Please read these terms of service (the "<b>Terms of Service</b>"), and any other terms applicable to the use of the Website, including the Website Terms of Use ("<b>Website Terms</b>"), the privacy & cookie policy (the "<b>Privacy Policy</b>"), as together they form the terms governing the relationship between us and you (collectively, the "<b>Terms</b>"). We may need to change or update our Terms from time to time as we strive to improve our services. We will notify you of any changes to the Terms either via email, a notification you will receive when accessing the Website, or other reasonable means, but it is your responsibility to read the Terms prior to using the Website or our services. If you do not consent to these Terms, you must cease access and use of the Website. Your continued use of the Website constitutes your acceptance of the Terms.</p>
            <p class="text-[#2d2d2d] text-base mt-5">When you place an order for products or services through our Website (an "<b>Order</b>"), you are deemed to have consented to the latest version of the Terms then posted on our Website. If a change in law takes effect which requires us to change our Terms after you have placed an Order but before it has been accepted by us, you acknowledge that the change will apply to your Order. In all other cases, the version of the Terms posted on the Website at the time your Order was placed will apply.</p>
            <h1 class="text-[20px] leading-[26px] uppercase text-[#2d2d2d] mt-5">ELIGIBILITY</h1>
            <p class="text-[#2d2d2d] text-base mt-5">The Website is for customers' personal use only. We do not provide the Website, products or the services supplied by us through the Website for commercial usage. We reserve the right to decline Orders of unusual quantities and/or where we suspect commercial usage by the purchaser. We may take any steps we deem necessary, including taking appropriate legal action against violators.</p>
            <h1 class="text-[20px] leading-[26px] uppercase text-[#2d2d2d] mt-5">PLACING ORDERS</h1>
            <p class="text-[#2d2d2d] text-base mt-5">When you place an Order with us, you commit to buy the items described in that Order, at the price displayed for each product on the Website, in addition to any service charges such as delivery fees, taxes and duties where applicable, at the time of placing the Order. We will send you an email acknowledging the receipt of your Order. However, Orders are subject to our acceptance, which will be communicated to you when you receive a notification from us confirming your Order has been processed by us and/or your item(s) have been dispatched for delivery. No party other than us has the authority to confirm acceptance of the Order. We may reject Orders at our sole discretion including for reasons such as errors in prices of products, other technical errors affecting the Website or the ordering process, ineligibility, inability to process payment, suspected fraud, suspected violation of the prohibition on commercial use of our Website, shipping restrictions or stock unavailability.</p>
            <h1 class="text-[20px] leading-[26px] uppercase text-[#2d2d2d] mt-5">STOCK AVAILABILITY</h1>
            <p class="text-[#2d2d2d] text-base mt-5">Items in your Website basket are not reserved until your Order is paid for in full and accepted by us. The Website (or our Website Call Centre) may contain or provide information regarding the availability of a particular item. The information provided on the Website is only an estimate and may not be up to date at the time of placing an Order due to the frequency of the transactions that are carried out on our Website. Unfortunately, we cannot always guarantee that an item which is displayed as in-stock on the Website at the time you placed it in your basket will be available at the time you place the Order. Should this happen, we will notify you and arrange for a full refund to your original payment method.</p>
            <h1 class="text-[20px] leading-[26px] uppercase text-[#2d2d2d] mt-5">PRE-ORDERED ITEMS</h1>
            <p class="text-[#2d2d2d] text-base mt-5">Some products can sell-out very quickly, so to give our customers a chance to get their hands on the items they want, we sometimes allow customers early access to coveted collections ahead of the official launch. Once your Order is placed, we will acknowledge the Order via email and work behind the scenes to secure the item for you. Once we receive the item, we will notify you and confirm that your item is being dispatched for delivery to you. If we are unable to secure stock of the item, we will notify you and refund you the price of the item to your original payment method, subject to our returns conditions, which you can find further down below in these Terms of service.</p>
            <p class="text-[#2d2d2d] text-base mt-5">Pre-Order items can only be paid for by debit card, credit card, Apple Pay or Payfort Instalments. No other payment methods (including cash on delivery, PayPal or Delayed Payment Providers) will be accepted for Pre-Ordered items. Pre-Order item can be cancelled at any time prior to delivery. Where a returned Pre-Order item is accepted by us it will be refunded as Ounass store credit only.</p>
            <h1 class="text-[20px] leading-[26px] uppercase text-[#2d2d2d] mt-5">CANCELLATION AND CHANGES</h1>
            <p class="text-[#2d2d2d] text-base mt-5">You may, at any time prior to your Order being marked as "Processed" on our online Order tracking system, contact us or use the Website to cancel or change the Order. If you do so, we will at your request either: (i) cancel the Order free of charge and issue you with a full refund, or (ii) we may agree to make certain changes to the Order, subject to stock availability and any applicable price adjustments. If the Order has already been processed by us, you will be unable to cancel the Order or make changes to the Order. You can return the items in accordance with our returns process after you receive the Order for a refund, and alternatively place a new Order with the items you wish to purchase.</p>
            <h1 class="text-[20px] leading-[26px] uppercase text-[#2d2d2d] mt-5">GIFT WITH PURCHASE</h1>
            <p class="text-[#2d2d2d] text-base mt-5">Some of our brands may offer customers a gift-with-purchase when the customer purchases an item from the brand. A gift-with-purchase will only apply on Orders which include items from the brands participating in the offer. You can find a list of the selected brands in the offer banner. The number of gifts available is limited, so the gift is distributed with the Order based on Order placement priority and subject to stock availability. Regional exclusions and minimum spending requirements may apply. Please be aware that items purchased in an Order will be non-returnable if the gift-with-purchase that was gifted with the Order is not returned or where the condition of the gift-with-purchase does not satisfy our returns conditions, including the condition of the packaging.</p>
            <h1 class="text-[20px] leading-[26px] uppercase text-[#2d2d2d] mt-5">GIFT BOXES AND WRAPPING</h1>
            <p class="text-[#2d2d2d] text-base mt-5">We offer gift-boxing and gift-wrapping services if you are looking to gift the Order. You can avail this service by selecting the option for gift boxing and gift wrapping at check-out. This service is not available for purchases of furniture or bulky items. You may select to have the items in your Order gift wrapped by us or you may request that we simply supply the gift boxes and gift wrapping along with your Order. The price for any gift-wrapping or gift-boxing service will be added to the total Order price and displayed at checkout. The fee charged for this service is non-refundable, even if you returned the Order.</p>
            <h1 class="text-[20px] leading-[26px] uppercase text-[#2d2d2d] mt-5">GIFT TAGGING AND GIFT MESSAGES</h1>
            <p class="text-[#2d2d2d] text-base mt-5">Gift tags and gift messages can be added to your Order free of charge by selecting this option on your checkout page prior to placing the Order.</p>
